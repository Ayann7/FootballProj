Football in itself does not have a Classical history. Not with standing any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA have recognized that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outsides Europe. The modern rules of football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardize the wildly varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. <br>
The history of football in England dates back to atleast the eighth century A.D.The Cambridge Rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, but they were not university adopted.<br>
During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or University were formed. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield football club, formed by Public School Pupils in 1857, which led to the formation pf a Sheffield FA in 1867.
<br>
The Sheiffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games. The worldâ€™s oldest Football competition is the FA cup, which was founded by C.W Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872.
