<p align="left" style="font-size:31">ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL, more commonly known as football or soccer is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the worldâ€™s most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opportunity goal.<br>

The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands while it is in play and only in their penalty area, outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use their head or torso to do so instead. The team that scores the most goals at the end of the match is the winner.<br>

If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/ or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The laws of the game were originally codified in England by the Football Association in 1863. Football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football.
